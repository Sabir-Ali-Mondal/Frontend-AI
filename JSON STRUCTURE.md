## JSON Structure Examples for Advanced AI Chatbot

## 1. Training Data (Q&A Pairs) - Flat Array Format

```json
[
  {
    "question": "what is artificial intelligence",
    "answer": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect."
  },
  {
    "question": "how does machine learning work",
    "answer": "Machine learning works by using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make predictions or decisions. It improves its accuracy over time without being explicitly programmed to do so."
  },
  {
    "question": "what are neural networks",
    "answer": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains. They consist of node layers with an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, allowing them to learn patterns in data."
  },
  {
    "question": "who invented the internet",
    "answer": "The Internet was not invented by a single person. It evolved from ARPANET, which was developed in the late 1960s by a team led by Robert Taylor and Larry Roberts. Tim Berners-Lee later invented the World Wide Web, which is what most people think of as the Internet."
